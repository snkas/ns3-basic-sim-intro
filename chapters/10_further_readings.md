# Chapter 10: Further readings

- If you are looking for a class in ns-3, it is useful to simply google "ns3 <class name>"
  and the first results will likely be the ns-3 doxygen documentation:
  
  https://www.nsnam.org/doxygen
  
  ns-3 also maintains a list of articles and tutorials to understand the framework better:
  
  https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/index.html
  https://www.nsnam.org/docs/tutorial/html/index.html
  
  From these, the following are good starting points:
  
  - The full ns-3 tutorial: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/tutorial/html/index.html
  - Point-to-point: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/point-to-point.html
  - Queue disciplines: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/queue-discs.html
  - Internet: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/internet-models.html
  - Traffic-control layer: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/traffic-control.html
  - Network module: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/network.html
  - Distributed: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/distributed.html
  - Making the nodes move (mobility): https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/mobility.html
  - Using ns-3 for emulation instead of simulation: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/emulation-overview.html

- Good book for experiment design and evaluation:

  The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: Techniques for Experimental Design, Measurement, Simulation, and Modeling
  by Raj Jain

- Good book to gain a deeper understanding of (distributed) discrete event simulation:

  Parallel and Distributed Simulation Systems
  by Richard M. Fujimoto
