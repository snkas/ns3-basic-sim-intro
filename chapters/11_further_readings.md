## Understanding ns-3 better

If you are looking for a class in ns-3, it is useful to simply google `ns3 [class name]`
and the first results will likely be the ns-3 doxygen documentation:

https://www.nsnam.org/doxygen

ns-3 also maintains a list of articles and tutorials to understand the framework better:

- https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/index.html
- https://www.nsnam.org/docs/tutorial/html/index.html

From these, the following are good starting points:

- The full ns-3 tutorial: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/tutorial/html/index.html
- Point-to-point: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/point-to-point.html
- Queue disciplines: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/queue-discs.html
- Internet: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/internet-models.html
- Traffic-control layer: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/traffic-control.html
- Network module: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/network.html
- Distributed: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/distributed.html
- Making the nodes move (mobility): https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/mobility.html
- Using ns-3 for emulation instead of simulation: https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/emulation-overview.html

## Experiment design

- Good book for experiment design and evaluation:

  The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis: Techniques for Experimental Design, Measurement, Simulation, and Modeling
  by Raj Jain
  
## Discrete event simulation

- Good book to gain a deeper understanding of (distributed) discrete event simulation:

  Parallel and Distributed Simulation Systems
  by Richard M. Fujimoto
  
## Linux network stack
